******************
Tutorials for Nept
******************

Here you can find the tutorials for uses of `nept`,
with some general neural data analysis focus.
We import the data and look into its core objects and their features.
Then we provide some examples such as generating tuning curves, 
computing power spectral densities, and handling purely behavioral data 
from a MedPC operant box.

Interactive
===========

These tutorials can be interactive in a jupyter notebook
with `nept` and its dependencies installed.
The only additional thing you need to do is download 
the tutorial data sets into the tutorials/data/ folder.

Contributing and expanding the tutorial scope
=============================================

We're always looking to improve the quality and usability of nept.
If you wish to expand the scope of the tutorial suite,
feel free to submit pull requests adhering to the 
`style guide <https://github.com/vandermeerlab/nept/blob/master/style_guide.rst>`_.
